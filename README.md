# Python-Projects
Repository for small Python projects developed by me.
I'm learning Python and will use this repository to share my projects and improvements to develop my programming skills in the languages.

## First Project
#### [Temperature Unit Conversion] (https://github.com/gonabur/Python-Projects/tree/main/Temperature%20Unit%20Conversion)
A small app built with Python using Tkinter & CustomTkinter libraries that converts between differents temperature units. The calculator language is Spanish.
